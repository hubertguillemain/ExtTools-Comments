# Educational purpose

The goal here is to provide a simple yet functional sample project that can easily be forked also by casual developers:
- No build process needed, just copy/paste (see How-to section below)
- Maintain look and feel using semantic UI
- Supports all modern Browsers, including necessary [Promise](https://www.promisejs.org/) polyfills for IE11+
- A single, easy to read file (main.js) with all the functional implementation to play with. Just leave the rest as it is and it should "just work"
- Configuration via a simple config.js file

# How-to

1. Download the whole package:
  - As zip from gihub web app
  - use git clone

2. Place the "comments" folder on your IIS server. 
  - either at the root of your Web site, or below your OpenMedia Web app
  - convert it to an APP
  - Make sure the apppool has sufficient privileges on the folder.

3. Configure the config/config.js file for field mappings
- Make sure to choose fields which do not have random data in it. 
- The plugin expects to find either it's own json data structure, or null
- You should probably choose a non-indexed field for the JSON data
- You should probably also add the configured fields to the list of Copy2Exception

4. In the Admin Tool, configure this external tool 
  - Access mode: NewsBoard / Template / Section
  - If you can, always use relative paths for the main Content URL
  - If you can make sure to use a fallback URL as absolute path
